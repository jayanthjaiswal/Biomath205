    "## Problem 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume the number of primes is finite i.e. the set of primes P = {$p_1,p_2,...,p_n$} has a finite cardinality (wlog, say n) and $p_i > 1$ $\\forall$ $1 \\leq i \\leq n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "As per above assumption, there is a prime $p_n$, s.t. $p_n$ is the largest prime in the set P. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, $\\forall x$, s.t. $x>p_n, x$ is composite.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, consider $x=(\\Pi_{i=1}^{n} p_i) + 1$.\n",
    "Clearly, $x > p_i$ $\\forall$ $1 \\leq i \\leq n$ and hence, based on above assumption x is composite.\n",
    "\n",
    "By Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, $\\exists i$, s.t. $p_i | x$ and $p_i \\in P$ i.e. $1 \\leq i \\leq n $, since x is composite.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\implies p_i | (\\Pi_{i=1}^{n} p_i) + 1$ \n",
    "\n",
    "But, $ p_i | (\\Pi_{i=1}^{n} p_i)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\implies p_i | 1$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, $ 1|p_i$ as 1 is identity element. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\implies p_i = 1$ \n",
    "\n",
    "We arrive at a contradiction as we assumed, $p_i > 1$ $\\forall$ $1 \\leq i \\leq n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, $x=(\\Pi_{i=1}^{n} p_i) + 1$ can't be composite, if the set P is finite.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, $x=(\\Pi_{i=1}^{n} p_i) + 1$ is prime, which is larger than $p_n$ and hence, $x=(\\Pi_{i=1}^{n} p_i) + 1 \\in P$ is the largest prime in that set P, which is a contradiction to the assumption that $p_n$ is the largest prime in finite set P.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the set P is not finite i.e. the number of primes is infinite.\n",

    "## Problem 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the equation $x^2 = 5y - 2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets consider the same equation in modulo 5 group, $U_5$. Hence, taking modulo on both sides, the equation will reduce to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$x^2 = 5y - 2$ mod $5. $\n",
    "\n",
    "Since, $ 5y$ mod $5 = 0$ mod $5$ as $ 5 | 5y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\implies x^2 = - 2$ mod $5. $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\implies x^2 = 3$ mod $5. $\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets say, such an integral solution $x$ exists and satisfies above modularity equation.\n",
    "Now, consider the congurent modulo 5 residue system. Any such number $x$ will have possible remainders in range {0,1,2,3,4} congurent modulo 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e., $x$ mod 5 $\\in$ {$0,1,2,3,4$}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, taking square, the possible values $x^2$ mod 5 can take will be in range {$0^2,1^2,2^2,3^2,4^2$}, i.e. {$0,1,4,9,16$} mod 5 = {$0,1,4,4,1$} mod 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "i.e., $x^2$ mod 5 $\\in$ {$0,1,4$}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is a contraction to the assumption $x^2 = 3$ mod $5$ has such an integral solution $x$ as $3 \\notin$ {$0,1,4$}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the equation $x^2 = 5y - 2$ has no integral solution.\n",
